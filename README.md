# LyeCalculator


Small AngularJS application to calculate Lye quantity to add to make soap


<h1>Principle</h1>

Lye quantity is calculated using molar mass of each component of oil.
<br>
Oils and fats are composed of several triglycerides. Saponification consists in transforming triglycerides into single fatty acids that are soap.

<br>
<br>
1 triglyceride + 3 Na-OH = 3 fatty acids + 1 glycerol + H2O
